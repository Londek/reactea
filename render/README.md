# Render

Goals of `render` are:

- Providing easy API for rendering component trees
- Providing CSS-like component rendering techniques

## But why?

With Render and Reactea I want to achieve similar level of responsiveness in TUI as in traditional web apps. I'm far from getting there, but definetely on right track.

## Lipgloss or Render?

Both, Lipgloss specializes in stricte frontend (user sees immediate effect). Render specializes in backend (abstraction) to make it work efficiently in Reactea.
