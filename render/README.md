# Render

Render is Reactea children, maybe it will make it to it's very own module, for now its future is uncertain.
Goals of `render` are:

- Providing easy API for width, height mathematics
- Providing CSS-like component rendering techniques

## But why?

With Render and Reactea in particular I want to achieve similar level of responsiveness in TUI as in traditional web apps. I'm far from getting there, definetely on right track.

## Lipgloss or Render?

Both, Lipgloss specializes in practical stuff, that user sees. Render specializes in backend, abstraction to make it work efficiently in reactea.
